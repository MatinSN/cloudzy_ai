Cloudzy AI Photo Management
Cloudzy is a cloud-based photo management service with AI-powered analysis and semantic search. It allows users to upload photos, automatically analyzes them using AI models, and provides intelligent features such as semantic search and creative AI-generated insights.

ðŸš€ Objective
Build a photo management service with the following requirements:

Photo Upload and Storage

POST /upload: Receive a photo, store it, and generate a unique ID.

GET /photo/:id: Return metadata including upload date, file name, and AI-generated tags and captions.

AI-Powered Analysis

Each uploaded photo must use a vision model (local or API-based) to produce:

Tags (at least 5 relevant)

Caption (short descriptive sentence)

Embedding vector (for semantic search)

Semantic Search

GET /search?q=... : Return photos ranked by semantic similarity using embeddings.

Mandatory AI-Powered Smart Feature

Include at least one creative AI-powered feature, e.g.:

Album generation

Daily summaries

Emotion/facial recognition

AI Usage Report

Document where and how AI was used

Provide prompts and model inputs

Explain how model outputs were refined

ðŸ“‚ Example Workflow
Upload a photo via /upload.

The system generates:

Tags and captions using AI

Embeddings for semantic search

Retrieve photo metadata via /photo/:id.

Search for photos with /search?q=<query> to find semantically similar images.

Enjoy AI-powered smart features like automatic album generation or summaries.

ðŸ¤– AI Usage
This project integrates AI in multiple stages:

Tagging and Captioning: Vision model automatically labels photos and generates descriptive captions.

Embedding Generation: Produces vector representations for semantic search.

Creative AI Features: Enhances user experience, e.g., grouping similar photos into albums or summarizing daily uploads.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
The service is designed for mandatory AI usageâ€”all main features leverage AI models.

This README uses Hugging Face Spaces front matter to define metadata, including color, emoji, and SDK type.
